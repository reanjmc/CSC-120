1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?
  The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items such as shirts, shoes, and bags.
  Each image is 28×28 pixels and belongs to one of 10 clothing categories.
  It is commonly used to train and test machine learning models for image classification.

2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?
  We normalize pixel values to scale them between 0 and 1.
  This helps the model train faster and more efficiently.
  Normalization also improves numerical stability and model performance.

3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.

  Flatten layer: Converts the 2D image into a 1D array.
  Dense (hidden) layer with ReLU: Learns important features from the data.
  Dense (output) layer with Softmax: Produces probabilities for each clothing class.

4. What does an epoch mean in model training?
  An epoch is one complete pass of the entire training dataset through the neural network.
  During each epoch, the model updates its weights.
  Multiple epochs help the model learn better patterns.

5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.
  The predicted label for the first test image is ________.
  The actual label is ________.
  The prediction (matches / does not match) the actual label.

6. What could be done to improve the model’s accuracy?
  We could train the model for more epochs.
  Adding more hidden layers or neurons may improve learning.
  Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and tuning hyperparameters could also increase accuracy.
